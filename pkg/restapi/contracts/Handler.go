// specUniformInterface
//
// As the constraint name itself applies,
// you MUST decide APIs interface for resources inside the system which are exposed to API consumers and follow religiously.
// A resource in the system should have only one logical URI, and that should provide a way to fetch related or additional data.
// Any single resource should not be too large and contain each and everything in its representation.
// Whenever relevant, a resource should contain links (HATEOAS) pointing to relative URIs to fetch related information.
// Also, the resource representations across the system should follow specific guidelines such as naming conventions,
// link formats, or data format (XML or/and JSON).
// All resources should be accessible through a common approach such as HTTP GET and similarly modified using a consistent approach.
// Once a developer becomes familiar with one of your APIs, he should be able to follow a similar approach for other APIs.

// specClientServer
//
// This constraint essentially means that client applications
// and server applications MUST be able to evolve separately without any dependency on each other.
// A client should know only resource URIs, and thatâ€™s all. Today, this is standard practice in web development,
// so nothing fancy is required from your side. Keep it simple.
// Servers and clients may also be replaced and developed independently, as long as the interface between them is not altered.

// specStateless
//
// Roy fielding got inspiration from HTTP, so it reflects in this constraint.
// Make all client-server interactions stateless.
// The server will not store anything about the latest HTTP request the client made.
// It will treat every request as new. No session, no history.
//
// If the client application needs to be a stateful application for the end-user,
// where the user logs in once and does other authorized operations after that,
// then each request from the client should contain all the information necessary to service the request.
// including authentication and authorization details.
//
// No client context shall be stored on the server between requests.
// The client is responsible for managing the state of the application.
