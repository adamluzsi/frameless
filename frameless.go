// Package frameless aims to create convention to build software from ground instead of upside down.
//
// What does this in in practice
//
// You can practice building software with clean seperation between layers.
// For example you can implement Business Usecases without any external dependency.
// I often saw that a developer like to challenge they mind and also to play around with new hyped modules or frameworks.
// In a software where there is no strict seperation between external interfaces and internal business rules / use cases,
// this easily mean that the software development will be throttled over time because reverse dependency injection.
//
// Initially the goal for this project was starting to extend my vision in software level architecture
// and find a way out for myself what is "clean" to me in terms of Architecture.
// As a side effect my software become even more easier to test, than before.
// By creating like this my software, it will be framework independent, and I can use whatever I want for my software channel (web/cli/mq/etc).
//
// I'm not saying this is the silver bullet here, because the actually usable real world usecases limited to business applications.
// If you need to create a service for an edge case purpose, than you probably better of without extra complexity layer,
// because would not make it cleaner, just more complex. Such case is building a reverse proxy that handles custom security rules and stuff like that.
// Also the design here highly assumes you create software that follows 12 factor principles, and scalable via the process model.
// I worked with languages that are anything but high-performant, so I have a different view about "required" performance,
// and I don't share the opinion that the application must be prematurely optimized for some extra nano seconds.
// Even with one of the slowest languages in the world you can architect and build scalable and quick business softwares,
// so golang is chosen for different reasons to be one of my favorite language.
//
// My main goals while design a business applications is maintainability, testability, scope limitation and testability for components.
// To me if golang would be slow I still would love to use it, because I really like how opinionated the language is.
//
// If you feel while using idioms from here, that your test are too simple and boring, than I already happy.
// Of course we not live in a world where every company open to give extra time to achieve this,
// so I started this project as a guideline to make myself and hopefully others able to create applications in a fast and efficient way.
// I try to create primary for myself conventions that on the long run help avoid common mistakes that usually crystalize out not when being developed,
// but when a software have to be updated later.
// Even if you are the one who have to update it, after a certain amount of time it can be easily happen that you easily end up watching your own code like a stranger would do.
// Usually the smaller the required mind model to be built, the faster you can interact with an application code base.
// And this is what this "meta" framework try to achieve.
//
// Therefore if your opinion includes any of the followings:
//  * I don't mind using interfaces
//  * I don't care speed differences between function calls on interface <=> struct
//  * I don't depend purely only on type check, I'm comfortable with tests as well.
// If you said yes to this, I guess there would be no harm continue reading this.
//
//
// Last notes
//
// As a last note, most of the interfaces defined here may look simple,
// but took much more time than it looks, so sometimes one function signature was created under days.
// I would like to ask you, if you see anything and care to share your constructive opinion,
// please feel free to create an issue where it can be discussed!

// Business Entity
//
// Entities encapsulate the most general and high-level rules of the application.
// 	"An entity can be an object with methods, or it can be a set of data structures and functions"
// 	Robert Martin
//
// I tried different structures during my research, and in the end the most maintainable one was an
// interface that describe the high level behavior of an entity and a shared runable specification.
// This shared specification used to test against the underling implementations.
// They behavior are the least likely to change when something external changes.
// 	For example, you would not expect these objects to be affected by how they used and what behavior they implement
// 	when a change to page navigation, or security happen.
//
// In other languages my preference is RSpec, Jasmine or Oleaster for creating shared specifications but it is up to you what you prefer the most.
// Also the Business Entity must not give back any value that is implementation specific!
// 	for example when you call a method/function on this entity, you should not receive sql rows object
//
// Example Entity:
//
// 		type User struct {
// 			ID        string
// 			Name      string
// 			Email     string
// 			Biography string
// 		}
//
//
package frameless

import (
	"context"
	"io"
	"testing"
)

// Entity represents a application defined expored/public structure with exported/public fields
// Entities encapsulate Enterprise wide business rules.
// An entity is a data structure with functions.
// In enterprise environment, this or the specification of this object can be shared between applications.
// If you donâ€™t have an enterprise, and are just writing a single application, then these entities are the business objects of the application.
// They encapsulate the most general and high-level rules.
// Entity scope must be free from anything related to other software layers implementation knowledge such as SQL or HTTP request objects.
//
// They are the least likely to change when something external changes.
// For example, you would not expect these objects to be affected by a change to page navigation, or security.
// No operational change to any particular application should affect the entity layer.
//
// By convention these structures should be placed on the top folder level of the project
//
type Entity = interface{}

// Controller defines how a framework independent controller should look
//  the core concept that the controller implements the business rules
// 	and the channels like CLI or HTTP only provide data to it in a form of application specific business entities
//
// 	The controller responds to the user input and performs interactions on the data model objects.
// 	The controller receives the input, optionally validates it and then passes the input to the model.
//
// To me when I played with the Separate Controller/UseCase layers in a production app, I felt the extra layer just was cumbersome.
// Therefore the "controller" concept here is a little different from traditional controllers but not different what most of the time a controller do in real world applications.
// Implementing business use cases, validation or you name it. From the simples case such as listing users, to the extend of executing heavy calculations on user behalf.
// The classical controller that provides interface between an external interface and a business logic implementation is something that must be implemented in the external interface integration layer itself.
// I removed this extra layer to make controller scope only to control the execution of a specific business use case based on generic inputs such as presenter and request.
// Also there is a return error which represent the unexpected and not recoverable errors that should notified back to the caller to teardown execution nicely.
//
//  The software in this layer contains application specific business rules.
//  It encapsulates and implements all of the use cases of the system.
//  These use cases orchestrate the flow of data to and from the entities,
//  and direct those entities to use their enterprise wide business rules to achieve the goals of the use case.
//
//  We do not expect changes in this layer to affect the entities.
//  We also do not expect this layer to be affected by changes to externalities such as the database,
//  the UI, or any of the common frameworks.
//  This layer is isolated from such concerns.
//
//  We do, however, expect that changes to the operation of the application will affect the use-cases and therefore the software in this layer.
//  If the details of a use-case change, then some code in this layer will certainly be affected.
