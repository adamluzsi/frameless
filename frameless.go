		"An entity can be an object with methods, or it can be a set of data structures and functions"
		Robert Martin

	In enterprise environment, this or the specification of this object can be shared between applications.
	If you donâ€™t have an enterprise, and are just writing a single application, then these entities are the business objects of the application.
	They encapsulate the most general and high-level rules.
	Entity scope must be free from anything related to other software layers implementation knowledge such as SQL or HTTP request objects.

	They are the least likely to change when something external changes.
	For example, you would not expect these objects to be affected by a change to page navigation, or security.
	No operational change to any particular application should affect the entity layer.

	By convention these structures should be placed on the top folder level of the project

	Interactor implement a business rule to a specific audience of the software.
	This interface here is only for documentation purpose.

		TL;DR:
			Using Interactor imposes discipline upon focusing on the audience who's business rule you works on.

	This can be a function or a struct of function, it's up to the implementation.
	It has to be implemented in a framework independent way.
	The function arguments should be explicit Entity structures or primitives.
	When stream of data required, use case should declare framework and technology independent data providers.

		In my future examples this data source will be fulfilled by Iterator pattern implementations.

	As an easy to follow practice that you start build your application by implementing domain use cases,
	until you have all your business logic / use case implemented.
	Your test should work only with Entity structures and primitives exclusively.

	If you cannot avoid to depend on external resources, use interface to represent they need.
	During my research, I played around multiple solutions, and the one I liked the most is the following:
	You describe in a shared specification, in a test that is Exposed and importable by the external interface specification,
	and in that you describe what is your expectation from the use-case point of view from the provided external resource,
	when you call it with a specific data structure. for more about this, read the "Query" and "Resource" type.

	Here is a definition from Robert Martin:

		The software in this layer contains application specific business rules.
		It encapsulates and implements all of the use cases of the system.
		These use cases orchestrate the flow of data to and from the entities,
		and direct those entities to use their enterprise wide business rules to achieve the goals of the use case.

		We do not expect changes in this layer to affect the entities.
		We also do not expect this layer to be affected by changes to externalises such as the database,
		the UI, or any of the common frameworks.
		This layer is isolated from such concerns.

		We do, however, expect that changes to the operation of the application will affect the use-cases and therefore the software in this layer.
		If the details of a use-case change, then some code in this layer will certainly be affected.


	When your application has all the use-case, then you decide the right external interface to expose them.

		TIP:
			If you don't know how to start, imagine that every audience category your system defines has a dedicated engineer.
			For example in case of a web-shop: Buyer, Seller, Content Manager, Application Manager, DataBaseAdministrator just to name a few.
			Each engineer work on one user story for one of the audience category. You are one of the engineers.
			Almost every other engineer on the other user stories push code really frequently (for example 1 push / min).

			How would you structure and create your code in a way that you are safe from merge conflicts ?
			How would you design your code dependency in a way that other engineers activity unlikely to affect your code ?

	Query is a Resource specific component.

		TL;DR:
			Query imposes discipline upon scope usage.
			So Query is a behavior specification and a data structure that helps use-cases to focus on the "what" instead of the "how".

	The main purpose is to Use Case specific behavior requirements from the technology specific implementation
	The Use Case implementation should never specify low level implementation of the storage usage, but represent it with a Query data structure that passed to the storage.
	The Query data structure should contain all the necessary data that required for the storage.
	Query type must define a Test method that describe the expected high level behavior when storage encounter this type of query.
	This way all the storage implementations use the same shared specification/test, and by that ensure the high level requirements for the use-cases.
	The Query type should not define anything other than the data types in its structure, and the expected behavior in the Test function,
	everything else is the responsibility of the use-cases who use it.
	If possible, its data structure should only include primitive fields.
	By convention this should be declared next to the use-case implementation who use it.
	If it's a generic query structure, than it should include a field that can hold a structure that can be used as a reference for creating fixture with the fixtures pkg New function.

	By convention the Query name should start with "[EntityName][FindLogicDescription]" so it is easy to distinguish it from other exported Structures,
	example: UserByName, UsersByName, UserByEmail

	// test should receive a tear-down/cleanup function as the last argument that will used to reset to the initial state the external resource.

	Resource are resources that implements interactions (queries) that the use case depends on.

		TL;DR:
			Resource (External) imposes discipline upon dependency inversion.
			You encapsulate all the technology specific implementations,
			as a separate structure that adapt to a predefined stable but easily extendable interface,
			so you can try anything out while frameworks and ORMs evolve,
			yet your domain rules will be keep safe from this changes.

	By removing tight integration and encapsulate it behind such a generic interface like this,
	we can freely swap the implementation and make testing much more easier for the domain rules.

	One specific Resource that received multiple implementations is the "storage",
	but the usage of these is generally applicable to any kind of external resource which you have to interact from use-cases or from controllers.

	While at first this may seems boilerplate and you would feel a nice ORM would do the same,
	but than you took over the responsibility of ensuring that the current ORM you choose to work with
	and its current API will be maintained and if needed, backward ported for your application.
	You may ask why not just update the project code base to the newest api in the use-cases, but then
	that update would be a violation to the dependency inversion rule,
	which defines that a change in external interfaces should never affect use-cases or Entities.

	So this interface aims to reduce interconnection between use-case layer and external interface layer.
	The first is that you define Query structures that define the behavior which needs to be implemented.
	The second but optionally requirement for this interface is a string field: `ext:"ID"`.
	which links the Entity structure to an external resource object.
	If the external resource use complex types to represent ID objects, they have to implement the serialization
	and the deserialization as well under the hood, without bothering the use-case or entity layer with it.

	The design heavily inspirited by the combination of Liskov substitution principle with the dependency inversion principle.
	While the External Resource interface provides a stable abstraction, the actual implementations can fulfil the implementations with the specific technology.
	This helps to easily remove any concrete dependency from other layers by only referring to a common stable non volatile interface.

	Indeed, software designers and architects work hard to reduce the volatility of interfaces.
	They try to find ways to add functionality to implementations without making changes to the interfaces.
	This is Software Design 101.
