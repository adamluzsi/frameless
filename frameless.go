// Entity encapsulate the most general and high-level rules of the application.
// 	"An entity can be an object with methods, or it can be a set of data structures and functions"
// 	Robert Martin
//
// In enterprise environment, this or the specification of this object can be shared between applications.
// If you donâ€™t have an enterprise, and are just writing a single application, then these entities are the business objects of the application.
// They encapsulate the most general and high-level rules.
// Entity scope must be free from anything related to other software layers implementation knowledge such as SQL or HTTP request objects.
//
// They are the least likely to change when something external changes.
// For example, you would not expect these objects to be affected by a change to page navigation, or security.
// No operational change to any particular application should affect the entity layer.
//
// By convention these structures should be placed on the top folder level of the project
type Entity = interface{}

// UseCase defines how a framework independent controller should look
//  the core concept that the controller implements the business rules
// 	and the channels like CLI or HTTP only provide data to it in a form of application specific business entities
//
// 	The controller responds to the user input and performs interactions on the data model objects.
// 	The controller receives the input, optionally validates it and then passes the input to the model.
//
// To me when I played with the Separate UseCase/UseCase layers in a production app, I felt the extra layer just was cumbersome.
// Therefore the "controller" concept here is a little different from traditional ukases but not different what most of the time a controller do in real world applications.
// Implementing business use cases, validation or you name it. From the simples case such as listing users, to the extend of executing heavy calculations on user behalf.
// The classical controller that provides interface between an external interface and a business logic implementation is something that must be implemented in the external interface integration layer itself.
// I removed this extra layer to make controller scope only to control the execution of a specific business use case based on generic inputs such as presenter and request.
// Also there is a return error which represent the unexpected and not recoverable errors that should notified back to the caller to tear-down execution nicely.
//
//  The software in this layer contains application specific business rules.
//  It encapsulates and implements all of the use cases of the system.
//  These use cases orchestrate the flow of data to and from the entities,
//  and direct those entities to use their enterprise wide business rules to achieve the goals of the use case.
//
//  We do not expect changes in this layer to affect the entities.
//  We also do not expect this layer to be affected by changes to externalises such as the database,
//  the UI, or any of the common frameworks.
//  This layer is isolated from such concerns.
//
//  We do, however, expect that changes to the operation of the application will affect the use-cases and therefore the software in this layer.
//  If the details of a use-case change, then some code in this layer will certainly be affected.

// Query is a Storage specific component.

// This way it maybe feels boilerplate for really dynamic and complex searches, but for those,
// I highly recommend to implement a separate structure that works with an iterator and do the complex filtering on the elements.
// This way you can use easy to implement and minimalist query logic on the storage, and do complex things that is easy to test in a filter struct.

	// the last argument, reset represent a cleanup/teardown mechanism to reset storage state to the initial default, before a new specification would be run.

// Or when there is no such query use case where you have to update something, why implement it ?
// There fore the developer free to define what specifications he need from a storage.
// The bundled storage implementations use the queries.Test specification which enforce common query usages.
//
// Storage that works with the bundled in queries require a special field in the data entity: ID.
// This ID field represent the link between the in memory entity and it's persisted version in the storage.

	// for simple use cases where returned iterator expected to only include 1 element I recommend using iterators.DecodeNext(iterator, &entity) for syntax sugar.
	// The use case common but I do not see benefit enforcing a First, FindOne or similar requirement from the storage.
	// For creating iterators for a single entity, you can use iterators.NewSingleElement.
