// Package frameless aims to create convention to build software from ground instead of upside down.
//
// But what does this in in practice? This package makes you be less productive in speed for short term! :)
//
// The goal of the package is the learning and practicing The Clean Architecture.
// By doing so you will create web/cli/{{ .ChannelName }} applications that actually external channel and framework independent.
//
// The Project goals not include to make the application have "maximum optimization".
// I worked with languages that are anything but highperformant, so I have a different view about "required" performance,
// and I don't share the opinion that the application must be prematurely optimized for some extra nano seconds.
// Even with one of the slowest languages in the world you can architect and build scalable and quick business softwares,
// so golang is chosen for different reasons to be one of my favorite language.
// My main goals with business applications is maintainability, responsibility/scope limitation for components.
// To me if golang would be slow I still would love to use it.
// If you feel that you have to create boring simple tests for a given component, than I already happy.
// Of course we not live in a world where every company open to give extra time to achieve this,
// so I started this project as a guideline to make myself and hopefully others able to create applications in a fast and efficient way.
// I try to create primary for myself conventions that on the long run help avoid common mistakes that usually crystalize out not when being developed,
// but when a software have to be updated later.
// Even if you are the one who have to update it, after a certain amount of time it can be easily happen that you easily end up watching your own code like a stranger would do.
// Usually the smaller the required mind model to be built, the faster you can interact with an application code base.
// And this is what this meta framework try to achieve.
//
// Therefore if your opinion includes any of the followings:
//  * I don't use interface because it's slower
//  * I don't use reflection because it's slower
//  * I don't use reflection and empty interfaces, because I lose type safety in compile time.
//  * I don't create tests because {{.Reasons}}
// ... please only continue to read if you prepared light headaches and some frustration.
// I believe everyone has it's own way to create they code, this is one of mine.
//
// By working disciplined and separate the scope of your code and enforcing law of demeter on your architecture,
// I believe the following can be achieved:
//
//  * boring code
//  * components with small mind model
//  * easy maintainability and extendability of your code
//  * strict separation between
//    * external interface
//    * external resource
//    * presentation (serialization layer)
//    * application control logic
//      * use cases
// 		* entities
//
//
// Yes but how will this help me to achieve this
//
// Basically because the overwhelming possibility to what technology use for a project,
// these days it's easy to loose priority and start build up software from upside down,
// starting with the technology and than implement business use cases in it,
// instead of defining the required business usecases and finding technology to it.
//
// So instead of starting to create pure Business rules and business core entities,
// the developer tricked into start working from End2End through external interface point of view.
// Such example is when a developer creates an application through testing (sometimes manually) from the webpage point of view,
// or like "If I click this html button on the side bar, there should be a new record in the database with xy".
// While it has faster impact in look, usually the business rules and usecases rarely defined and created independently from the given technology specification or to the given framework.
//
// While following the ideologies presented in the project, you will create applications that will be build from ground.
// You will basically create the pure business entities, than business "use cases"/rules with them,
// and as a final move, you choose what should be the external interface (cli/mq/http/{{.Channel}}).
//
//
// Last notes
//
// As a last note, most of the interfaces defined here may look simple,
// but took much more time than it looks, so sometimes one function signature was created under days.
// I would like to ask you, if you see anything and care to share your constructive opinion,
// please feel free to create an issue where it can be discussed!

// Business Entity
//
// Entities encapsulate the most general and high-level rules of the application.
// 	"An entity can be an object with methods, or it can be a set of data structures and functions"
// 	Robert Martin
//
// I tried different structures during my research, and in the end the most maintainable one was an
// interface that describe the high level behavior of an entity and a shared runable specification.
// This shared specification used to test against the underling implementations.
// They behavior are the least likely to change when something external changes.
// 	For example, you would not expect these objects to be affected by how they used and what behavior they implement
// 	when a change to page navigation, or security happen.
//
// In other languages my preference is RSpec, Jasmine or Oleaster for creating shared specifications but it is up to you what you prefer the most.
// Also the Business Entity must not give back any value that is implementation specific!
// 	for example when you call a method/function on this entity, you should not receive sql rows object
//
// Example:
//
//		type User interface{
//			frameless.Persistable
//
//			Name() string
//			Email() string
//			Biography() string
//		}
//
//
// Handling relationship between business entities
//
// Relations between business entities should be implemented by function relations and controller should not know how to query the underling structure.
// For example:
//
//		type User interface{
//			frameless.Persistable
//			Teams() frameless.HasManyRelationship
//		}
//
//
//

// Entity represents a application defined expored/public structure with exported/public fields
// Entities encapsulate Enterprise wide business rules.
// An entity is a data structure with functions.
// In enterprise environment, this or the specification of this object can be shared between applications.
// If you donâ€™t have an enterprise, and are just writing a single application, then these entities are the business objects of the application.
// They encapsulate the most general and high-level rules.
// Entity scope must be free from anything related to other software layers implementation knowledge such as SQL or HTTP request objects.
//
// They are the least likely to change when something external changes.
// For example, you would not expect these objects to be affected by a change to page navigation, or security.
// No operational change to any particular application should affect the entity layer.
//
// By convention these structures should be placed on the top folder level of the project
//
type Entity = interface{}

// Controller defines how a framework independent controller should look
//  the core concept that the controller implements the business rules
// 	and the channels like CLI or HTTP only provide data to it in a form of application specific business entities
//
// 	The controller responds to the user input and performs interactions on the data model objects.
// 	The controller receives the input, optionally validates it and then passes the input to the model.
//
// To me when I played with the Separate Controller/UseCase layers in a production app, I felt the extra layer just was cumbersome.
// Therefore the "controller" concept here is a little different from traditional controllers but not different what most of the time a controller do in real world applications.
// Implementing business use cases, validation or you name it. From the simples case such as listing users, to the extend of executing heavy calculations on user behalf.
// The classical controller that provides interface between an external interface and a business logic implementation is something that must be implemented in the external interface integration layer itself.
// I removed this extra layer to make controller scope only to control the execution of a specific business use case based on generic inputs such as presenter and request.
// Also there is a return error which represent the unexpected and not recoverable errors that should notified back to the caller to teardown execution nicely.
//
//  The software in this layer contains application specific business rules.
//  It encapsulates and implements all of the use cases of the system.
//  These use cases orchestrate the flow of data to and from the entities,
//  and direct those entities to use their enterprise wide business rules to achieve the goals of the use case.
//
//  We do not expect changes in this layer to affect the entities.
//  We also do not expect this layer to be affected by changes to externalities such as the database,
//  the UI, or any of the common frameworks.
//  This layer is isolated from such concerns.
//
//  We do, however, expect that changes to the operation of the application will affect the use-cases and therefore the software in this layer.
//  If the details of a use-case change, then some code in this layer will certainly be affected.

// this also includes complex types that holds logical information.
// It should only include as primitive fields as possible,
// and anything that require some kind of rule/logic to be done before it can be found in the storage should be done at controller level.
//
// By convention this should be declared where the Controllers are defined.
// If it's used explicitly by one Controller, the query use case definition should defined prior to that controller
// and listed close to each other in the go documentation.

	// This way it maybe feels boilerplated for really dynamic and complex searches, but for those,

	// for simple use cases where returned iterator expected to only include 1 element I recommend using iterators.DecodeNext(iterator, &entity) for syntax sugar.

	// For creating iterators for a single entity, you can use iterators.NewForStruct.

	// Exec can execute a QueryUseCase that goal is to do modification in the storage in a described way by the QueryUseCase#Test method.
