// QueryOneMethodSignature defines the structure of a "query one" method signature.
// It outlines how the method should retrieve a single entity and communicate the outcome.
//
// The method returns three values:
// - The requested entity (_ENT)
// - A boolean 'found' indicating if the entity was located
// - An error if something went wrong during execution
//
// Instead of using an error to signal a "not found" case, this signature uses the boolean 'found'.
// This clearly separates cases where the entity was not found from actual errors,
// making it explicit that no error occurred, but simply no matching entity was located.
//
// Why return a boolean 'found' instead of using a nil pointer *ENT value?
//
// There are several reasons for this:
// - The go-vet tool ensures that the 'found' variable is checked before using the entity.
// - It improves readability and highlights the method's cyclomatic complexity by making the flow easier to understand.
//
// The method signature express the following cyclomatic complexity factors:
// - found/bool: Entity found (true) or not (false)
// - error: An error occurred (true) or did not (false)
//
// This approach also prevents returning an initialized pointer that may be nil,
// which could lead to a runtime error when cast to an interface:
//
//	(MyInterface)((*ENT)(nil)) != nil
//
// Similar patterns exist in the standard library,
// such as handling SQL null values and environment variable lookups in the os package.

// QueryManyMethodSignature defines the structure of a "query many" method signature,
// designed to handle queries that return an unknown number of entities.
//
// The method returns two values:
// - An iterator of entities (iterators.Iterator[ENT]), allowing efficient retrieval of multiple results
// - An error, which is only returned if there was a fundamental issue with the query itself
//
// The use of an iterator is key when the result set size is unknown or large.
// It enables processing the results as they are fetched, without needing to load everything into memory at once.
//
// This pattern also improves resource management by fetching results incrementally,
// making it suitable for working with large datasets or slow data sources.
//
// Why return an iterator?
//
//  1. It provides flexibility in handling a varying number of entities, allowing the caller
//     to iterate over results efficiently, without requiring all data upfront.
//  2. It separates concerns, using an error return to indicate issues with the query execution.
//  3. It enables the support for supporting a streaming gateway to our application.
//
// Similar to standard library patterns like SQL row iterators,
// this approach offers control over how the caller consumes the results,
// ensuring both performance and clarity in handling multiple entities.
